The FHIR Specimen Resource is defined as a sample to be used for analysis.
Scope and usage extends to any material sample which is taken from a biological entity, living or dead or taken from a physical object or the environment.
Some specimens are biological and can contain one or more components including but not limited to cellular molecules, cells, tissues, organs, body fluids, embryos, and body excretory products (source: NCI Thesaurus , modified).
The specimen resource covers substances used for diagnostic and environmental testing.
